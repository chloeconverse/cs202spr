  <p>This is a flat, easy walk along a bright blue lake called Lake Louise in Canada. You walk on a wide path with big
    mountains and a glacier around you. It's perfect for kids and anyone who likes pretty views without climbing.

  <p>The Pipiwai Trail is in Hawaii, on the island of Maui. It takes you through a cool bamboo forest, past a big
    tree,
    and ends at a tall waterfall. It's not too hard, and the jungle feels like a fun adventure for families.

  <p>This is a walk between two colorful villages called Monterosso and Vernazza in Italy. The Cinque Terre Trail has
    amazing sea views and cute houses on cliffs. It's a bit hilly, but many families enjoy it, and you can take a
    train
    back if you get tired.
